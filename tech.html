			<div class="handwithheart-intro">
				<p>This project, Hand with Heart, provides an indirect way for people to interact with each other. There will be two projectors placing in two spaces. Beneath each projector, there is a motion tracking device which can track user's hand movement. Hand movement of the two users will be mapped on the same screen. When their hands' positions match on the screen, special effects will be triggered. </p>

				<h2>Doodling +</h2>

			<div class="doodling-intro">
				<p>Inspired by Google’s Just a Line, Doodling + is an AR Doodling app combined with social-interaction functions. It allows the user to create virtual doodles in the AR space, mark down the location of their doodles and share it with users elsewhere. It encourages people to go outside with their smart device and offers a way for people to release their creativity. As an app built with Apple’s ARKit, anyone who has an iOS device that supports AR function can access it.</p>

				<p>This system is designed to provide an interactive and exploratory page that is easy to read, understand, and navigate for all age groups of users. The system is designed in a linear structure with three views connected by transition pages. The user can navigate across the three views through simply scrolling the mouse.</p>

				<h2>FaceX</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="facex-intro">
				<p>The FaceX dataset follows a standardized design. We designed four different frameworks to depict faces of different styles. This framework was designed to depict cartoon characters. Then we made some adjustment on the proportion and the size of facial elements so they can fit into different styles. We used smooth strokes and symmetric proportion which we believe has more attractiveness. </p>

				<p>To achieve my goal, I used sketchRNN. By adopting the Quick Draw! dataset, sketchRNN showed an amazing performance in reconstructing different types of doodle works created by users. The unique part of sketchRNN is that it has a sequence-by-sequence autoencoder, which is able to predict the next stroke based on the last one. When combining this feature with the p5.js library using magenta.js, it can draw doodles line by line like a real person.</p>
