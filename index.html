				<p>This project focuses on bringing back people's connection in a gentle way. In a digital age, people's connection becomes fragile and superficial. Social awkward appears frequently in our daily life. People sometimes feel less willing to talk. They become more likely to seek a relationship which can leave enough space for both sides. The interactive Head with Heart aimed to provide a solution toward this issue. </p>

				<p>The modern lifestyle is fast-paced and brings people from all over the world to live and work together. Facing intense living pressure, people become less likely to have interaction with others nor explore the outside world. To deal with this issue, the Doodling + is designed to explore an interesting way to link people together by using the doodles in the augmented-reality space.</p>

				<h2>FaceX</h2>
				<p>FaceX is a dataset designed specifically for an RNN-based neural network. It contains 5 million different sketch faces. It is organized in 84 categories, includes 2 genders (male, female), 3 styles (cartoom, minimalism, realism), 2 perspectives (front, lateral) and 7 expressions (neutral, angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise).</p>

				<p>Ancient Chinese text is sometimes challenging for modern Chinese people to understand due to its different charac- ters and grammatical structures. Therefore, we believe there exist substantial underlying aesthetic, educational, and aca- demical values in ancient Chinese text yet to be discovered. This research project specifically focuses on presenting the colors and imageries that appear in ancient Chinese text, and their relationships with the authors in an interactive and ex- ploratory way, through the utilization of the modern text vi- sualization tools.</p>

				<h2>Shu Hua</h2>
				<p>Inspired by Xu Bing's the Book from the Sky, in which he used strokes of the Chinese character to create over 4,000 fake Chinese characters, this project aimed to find a way of generating Kanji characters by using sketchRNN.  I hope this project can serve as an interesting way for the audience to feel the beauty of Chinese characters and create something new.</p>

				<p>This project was inspired by one piece in the Chinese traditional classic Daodejing, in which it describes a mythical creature Kun. Kun is described as "it's back is I do not know how many thousand li in breadth. When it is moved, it flies, it wings obscuring the sky like clouds"</p>
