					<p>Colors used in this work are only red, white and black, which gives the picture a concise and clear look. There is only two shots in the whole animation. An effect of camera movement was achieved by manipulating motion of different objects. The background sounds are made of varies of sound effect pieces found on the FreeSound and cut together in Adobe Audition.</p>

					<p>The basic logic of interaction are just short click, long click, and scrolling. When those interactions are applied in different views, it will trigger different functions.  There are some consistency in the color schema. When a friend request is sent to a stranger, the color of its bubble will turn to a gradient color between red and blue.</p>

					<p>Started from the image of Kun, we mapped this concept into a half-bio-half-machine creature which serves as an ark to transport survivors in a space age. A little boy, who was the first person woke up from a long journey, serves as a main character and try to save the mission. There is no disturbing instructions, all that the player need to do is to roam around and explore the whole map to see what can be done. </p>
